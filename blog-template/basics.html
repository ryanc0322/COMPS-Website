                        <h2><strong>Basics</strong></h2>
                        <p>The purpose behind the set of Basics assignments is to be a basic introduction to some of the most important features of Python.  This includes the various data types that the students will continue to use throughout the course, as well as both print statements and taking user input.  Through the course of the in-class work and homework assignment, the students will familiarize themselves with these features as well as learn how to approach solving various errors that they may come across in the duration of this course.  They are also introduced to the real-life implications of their code on the world by having them address a variety of situations that they can draw real-world connections to.  This lays the groundwork for the rest of the course by both preparing them to think critically about their code and how it can impact others.</p>

                        <h3>Basics Assignment: Work Planner</h3>
                        <article class="line">
                           <p>The homework assignment focuses on reenforcing the concepts that we would have covered in class.  This involves working with different data types, like floats, integers, and strings, as well as being able to print things to the terminal and take in user input.  This is structured with the context of a gig economy work planning app.  We decided that this would be a good context to frame this assignment in because the planner itself only requires to do some basic mathematical calculations while being a topic that most students would be familiar with.  Throughout the assignment, we are both guiding the students with code snippets and asking them reflective questions so that they are not feeling lost, but also having to think critically throughout the assignment.

                           <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
                           <p>
                              In order to prepare the students for the Take-Home Assignment that we discussed previously, we also needed to create a week’s worth of materials to do in-class.  Since this is the first assignment, and the first time some of the students have ever seen code before, we wanted to make sure the introduction was approachable while still allowing for the students to truly get their feet wet with Python.
                              <br>
                              <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                              We thought the most universal and inviting way to do this is by having an Introductory Slide Deck that the professor would walk through and prompt discussion throughout, also having the students start thinking about the worksheet that we also wanted to include for the first two days.  The slides cover very basic topics like different data types, how to use print statements and common error messages.  This allows for students to start building their understanding instead of being immediately thrown in the deep-end with an in-class lab to start out with.
                              <br>
                              <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                              The in-class worksheet emphasized the learning that was covered in the slides by also prompting students to enforce their learning through testing their answers with VS Code.  This builds the connections between what their gut feeling says about the topics being covered.  For example, one of the parts of the assignment asks for students to identify what kind of error message would occur for the example code provided.  After analyzing it for themselves, they can go in and see if their hypothesis is right by typing the lines into VS Code.  With this connection building, it will hopefully help students recognize potential places for error easier in their code.
                              <br>
                              <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                              The final section we decided was necessary to prepare students for their homework is an in-class lab.  In-class labs facilitate growth because students can get immediate feedback for their code from both the professor and their peers.  The in-class lab also allows for us to once again place real-world impacts at the forefront of our code by having them code things that they might have experienced in real life, like calculating tips or calculating their GPA.  These tasks are more simple than the actual homework, but they are similar enough that the strategies the students develop should be applicable for the homework while still engaging them with real-life examples.
