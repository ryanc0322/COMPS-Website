                        <p>The following assignment and in-class activities allow students to practice the technical skill of working with conditionals and loops in Python. Throughout, they also reflect on asking relevant questions when lending loan, and how to format / save them in an appropriate way. We chose this technical skill because it was one of our favorites when taking Introduction to Computer Science classes, and we believe it is relevant for students who may not be majoring in Computer Science.</p>

                        <h3>Conditionals and Loops Assignment: Loan Approval System</h3>
                        <article class="line">
                           
                           <p>In the take-home assignment, students will work with four different loan approval systems: 
                           <br>
                           <br>
                              <ul>
                                 <li><a href="https://github.com/ryanc0322/Fall2025-COMPS/blob/main/conditionals/StudentFacing/loanApproval_bad.py">loanApproval_bad.py</a></li>
                                 <li><a href="https://github.com/ryanc0322/Fall2025-COMPS/blob/main/conditionals/StudentFacing/loanApproval_mediocre.py">loanApproval_mediocre.py</a></li>
                                 <li><a href="https://github.com/ryanc0322/Fall2025-COMPS/blob/main/conditionals/StudentFacing/loanApproval_better.py">loanApproval_better.py</a></li>
                                 <li><a href="https://github.com/ryanc0322/Fall2025-COMPS/blob/main/conditionals/StudentFacing/loanApproval_good.py">loanApproval_good.py</a></li>
                              </ul>
                           <br>
                           The assignment is divided into 2 parts: improving the loan approval system and reflecting on ethical considerations. This structure allows students to build on their skills, beginning with coding and ending with reflection.
                           Throughout the coding portion, students practice using conditionals and loops to validate input, process data, and make decisions. In the reflection portion, students consider the ethical implications of their code and the assumptions they made about users.
                           There are four different loan approval systems provided, each with varying levels of complexity and ethical considerations. Students review and modify these files, improving the criteria and logic for loan approval while being mindful of fairness and bias.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           Formatting the assignment around a loan approval system allowed us to highlight real world issues related to financial accessibility and ethical algorithm design. We ask students to reflect on their choices in designing their program throughout the assignment, and how technical choices can have real world effects on potential users.

                           <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
                           <p>
                           The lecture material and in-class activities introduce technical skills for working with conditionals and loops in a similar but different way to the take-home assignment.
                           In order to highlight different aspects of conditionals and loops, the in-class activities depart from the loan approval theme used in the assignment.
                           The in-class activities have multiple questions and labs spread out over a week: where for each questions there are both applications to real-world scenarios and technical coding practice.
                           With different scenarios and applications, students are able to see the versatility of conditionals and loops in programming.

                           <br>
                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           Throughout the week, students will go through three different activities: follow-through code for conditionals, follow-through code for loops, and a final lab worksheet.
                           The follow-through codes allow students to see examples of how conditionals and loops are used in practice, while the final lab worksheet gives students hands-on experience writing their own code.

                           <br>
                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           We selected a follow-through code for the first and second day because, in our experience, it’s helpful to be able to see examples of how conditionals and loops are used in practice. The lab on the third day gives students hands-on experience writing their own code.
