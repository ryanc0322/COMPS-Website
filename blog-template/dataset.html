                        <p>The following assignment and in-class activities allow students to practice the technical skill of working with datasets in Python. Throughout, they also reflect on data privacy, the limitations of data, and the responsibilities programmers have when working with data. We chose this technical skill because it was one of our favorites when taking Introduction to Computer Science classes, and we believe it is relevant for students who may not be majoring in Computer Science.</p>

                        <h3>Data Assignment: Health Records</h3>
                        <article class="line">
                           
                           <p>In the take-home assignment, students analyze a .csv of synthetic patient health records.
                           The dataset, obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset?resource=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Health Care Data">Kaggle</a>,
                           was chosen because it is clean, easy to understand, but still large enough to be meaningful. We modified a few columns to create more interesting results. For example, our version includes only 5 hospitals.
                           The assignment is divided into 3 parts: exploring the data, analyzing the data, and visualizing the data. This structure allows students to build on their skills, beginning with printing rows, to ending with creating graphs.

                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           Using healthcare data allowed us to highlight issues related to social and civic responsibility. Students reflect on data privacy and the limitations of data. For example, they read about the  underrepresentation of minorities in datasets used to train AI models. While their work isn’t at the same level of technicality as an AI model, they consider how the conclusions they draw from this dataset don’t reflect the full truth.

                           <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
                           <p>
                           The lecture material and in-class activities introduce technical skills for working with datasets in a similar way to the take-home assignment.
                           Students first practice these skills during class and then apply them independently in the assignment, allowing repetition to reinforce their learning.
                           The class material uses data from the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/ " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="COVID Tracking Project">COVID Tracking Project</a>.
                           <br>
                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           Throughout the week, students reflect on the limitations of data, similar to their assignment, and how choices we make affect data interpretation. On the first day, students explore the dataset in two ways: (1) by visiting the COVID Tracking Project website to read about the dataset and learn about how race data is inconsistently reported, and (2) by using Python to print and inspect different parts of the dataset. This helps students begin thinking about the limitations of real-world data. 
                           On the second and third days, students look at different misleading data visualizations, prompting them to reflect on the responsibility we have to represent data accurately.
                           <br>
                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           We selected a worksheet for the first day because, in our experience, it’s helpful to be able to draw when conceptualizing lists and indexing. The lab on the second day gives students hands-on coding practice and builds confidence for their take-home assignment. Finally, the gallery walk on the last day promotes collaboration and gives variety to discussion.
