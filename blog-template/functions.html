                        <p>The following assignment and in-class activities allow students to practice the technical skill of working with functions in Python. Throughout, they also reflect on data privacy, the limitations of data, and the responsibilities programmers have when working with data. We chose this technical skill because it was one of our favorites when taking Introduction to Computer Science classes, and we believe it is relevant for students who may not be majoring in Computer Science.</p>

                        <h3>Functions Assignment: Online Shopping Simulator</h3>
                        <article class="line">
                           
                           <p>In the take-home assignment, create a simple online shopping simulator using functions to handle various tasks such as purchasing items, calculating totals, and applying discounts.
                           The students will use a dataset, formatted in a csv file, that contains product information including names, prices, categorys, and whether a payment plan is available. The dataset is synthethic created from prompting
                           Gemini with "Can you create a CSV that has a list of about 100 of the most purchased items on Amazon with their prices and if they have a payment plan available?".
                           The dataset is simple enough for student to undetstand while still exposing them to files with mutliple data types and substantial amounts of data.
                           The assignment is divided into 5 parts: purchase, offer products, payment plans, discounts, and simulation. This structure allows students to build on their skills, letting them begin working with modular code and build up functions over time.
                           <br>
                           Using online shoppoing data allowed us to highlight real world issues related to addictive algorithm design and over consumption. We ask students to reflect on their choices in designing their program throughout the assignment, and how technical choices can have real world effects on potential users.

                           <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
                           <p>
                           The lecture material and in-class activities introduce technical skills for working with functions similarly to how they will be used in the take home assignment.
                           Students first practice these skills during class and then apply them independently in the assignment, allowing repetition to reinforce their learning. 
                           Students work with a synthethic dataset focused on bank account information, created from prompting Gemini with "Can you create a CSV that has a list of 100 bank accounts with account id, balances, and account holder names?". 
                           <br>
                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           Throughout the week, students reflect on the ethical implications of handling sensitive data, such as bank account information, and the responsibilities programmers have in ensuring data privacy and security.
                           Students additionally reflect on how their implementation choices can harm users, such as through biased algorithms or poor user experience design.
                           <div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>
                           Students will get a small formal introduction to functions on the first day, knowling that they have already been exposed to functions in previous assignments. Afterwards, for the rest of the week, students will work to complete an in class lab that has many similarities to their take home assignment.
