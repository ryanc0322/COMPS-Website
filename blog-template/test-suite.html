                        <h1>Test Suite Framework</h1>
                        <p> The Test Suite is created in a way to make grading more consistent and efficient through automation of the student code submissions evaluations.
                           It is designed to set things easier for students by giving them immediate feedback on their code for its correctness and style, which allows them to learn and improve their coding skills effectively.
                           The Test Suite framework consists of three main components: Pytest, Coverage.py, and Pylint, where each component serves a specific purpose in the testing and evaluation process:
                           pytest for functional correctness, coverage.py for measuring how thoroughly a submission is tested, and pylint for enforcing readable, maintainable code.
                           Together, these tools allows us to catch logical errors and edge cases in student solutions, ensure that key parts of the assignment are being implemented and executed, and encourage good coding practices early.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Pytest</h2>
                        <p> Pytest is a testing framework for Python that we used to write and run test cases efficiently for student submitted code. We created robust test cases for each of our assignments to ensure that we tested students were learning the technical concepts.</p>

                        <h2>Coverage.py</h2>
                        <p> Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. We used it to determine what amount of the code was used during testing, so that we can more efficiently know what parts of the assignment code that we tested for. The covergae percentage varied for each of our testing suites since each assignments has different level of student choice baked into the assignment structure. </p>

                        <h2>Pylint</h2>
                        <p> Pylint is a static code analysis tool for Python that helps us enforce coding standards and identify potential errors or code smells in student submissions. It ensures that the student code adheres to best practices. We decided on a having a universal Pylint file across all of our assignments as to reduce confusion amongst Intro students. Enforcing good coding practice early will make later assignments easier, so having them practice with the less challenging concepts should hopefully allow for them to build up healthy coding habits. The aspects that we chose to enforce were good variable naming through banning typical uninformative variable names, limiting the number of lines that can be included in a function, limiting the number of arguments to functions as well as other criteria that can be found in the .pylintrc file in any of our testing folders.
                        <br>

                        We did lower the floor for this grading though by having a module that allows both camel and snake case for variables, provided the students choose one and stick with it throughout the assignment. We do not want to penalize students for not immediately adhering to Python convention, so as long as they are trying we want to give them credit.
